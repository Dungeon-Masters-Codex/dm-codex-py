# Dungeon Master's Codex
Python Backend API for the Dungeon Master's Codex App

## MVP (remove me):
* Can create an account to be a DM (dungeon_masters table). Let basic auth be an option but let's also (for mvp) add google Oauth: https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/oauth-authentication-with-flask-in-2023
* DM can CRUD campaigns
* DM can CRUD players if they have a campaign to assign them to
* DM can CRUD sessions if they have a campaign to assign them too
* Endpoints were developed with TDD (100% coverage is MVP)

## Development: Getting Started
