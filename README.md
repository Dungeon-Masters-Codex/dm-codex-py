# dm-codex-py
Python Backend API for the Dungeon Master's Codex App

## MVP (remove me):
* Can create an account to be a DM (dungeon_masters table)
* DM can CRUD campaigns
* DM can CRUD players if they have a campaign to assign them to
* DM can CRUD sessions if they have a campaign to assign them too
* Endpoints were developed with TDD (100% coverage is MVP)
